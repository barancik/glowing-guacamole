\section{Targeted Paraphrasing}
Targeted paraphrasing for MT evaluation is introduced in~\citet{kauchak}. They 
focus on lexical substitution in Chinese-to-English translations. 
They select all pairs of words for which one word appears in a reference sentence,
second word in a hypothesis (the MT output), but none of them in both. They keep 
only pairs of synonymous words, i.e. words appearing in the same WordNet 
\cite{wordnet} synset. Each such a pair of words was further contextually evaluated. 
For every confirmed synonym, a new reference sentence is created by placing it to the
reference sentence on the position of its synonym.
