\section{Depfix}
\label{tools_depfix}
 It consists of a
set of~linguistically-motivated rules and a statistical component that correct
various kinds of errors, especially in grammar (e.g. morphological agreement),
using a range of natural language processing tools to provide analyses of input 
sentences. \todo{tato cast bude nekde nahore mezi Nastroji}
% Tady bych src vlastně asi vůbec nepotřeboval, ty opravy co dělám ho přímo
% nevyužívaj, spíš jen pro kontrolu toho jestli analýza češtiny je rozumná;
% ale to by nebylo potřeba kontrolovat kdyby se analyzovala ta reference

%It relies heavily on the availability of the source English
%sentences, which provide additional information both for the analyses and for
%the error correction.

\section{Treex}
\label{treex}

Treex \cite{treex} is highly modular NLP software system developed for machine translation system TectoMT \cite{tectomt} that translates on a deep syntactic layer. 

Treex is open-source and is available on GitHub,\footurl{https://github.com/ufal/treex} including the two blocks for paraphrasing and reordering that we contributed. 

Treex implements a stratificational approach to language, adopted from the Functional Generative Description theory \cite{FGP} and its later extension by the Prague Dependency Treebank \cite{PDT3.0}. 
It represents sentences at four layers:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{w-layer:} word layer; no linguistic annotation
\item \textbf{m-layer:} morphological layer; sequence of tagged and lemmatized 
tokens
\item \textbf{a-layer:} shallow-syntax/analytical layer; sentence is 
represented as a surface syntactic dependency tree
\item \textbf{t-layer:} deep-syntax/tectogrammatical layer; sentence is 
represented as a deep-syntactic dependency tree, where autosemantic words (i.e.
semantically full lexical units) only have their own nodes; t-nodes consist of
a~t-lemma and a~set of~attributes -- a \textit{formeme} (information about the original syntactic form) and a set of \textit{grammatemes} 
(essential morphological features).
\end{itemize} 

In our experiment with rule based paraphrase generation, we take the analysis and generation pipeline from the TectoTM system. 
We transfer both a hypothesis and its corresponding reference sentence to the t-layer, where we integrate a module for t-lemma paraphrasing. 
After paraphrasing, we perform synthesis to a-layer, where we plug in a reordering module and continue with synthesis to the w-layer.
